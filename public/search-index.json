Learn how the Weight Watchers point system works like a programming algorithm.\" tags: - Health - Programming - Weight Watchers - Personal Development categories: - Health --- Consider this: programmers are typically overweight. It's our nature. Ninety-five percent of our job is sitting behind a desk and hacking at a keyboard. The most movement we get is walking to the bathroom, and going to our car to go to the drive thru. About a month ago, I was turned onto the Weight Watchers plan, and it immediately occurred to me that this is the perfect diet plan for developers.

Google gives the definition: a scientist who specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computers. In most of our minds, a computer scientist is a person that builds computer systems. More recognizable names (at least in terms of what a person with a computer science degree would be hired for) for a computer scientist would be developer, coder, software engineer, or software architect. A lot of people will argue with me that computer scientist is more than just a coder, and I would fully agree. Although, when a perso"
