Recently, I updated a client application to the latest versions of SignalR (including the NPM module). One of our users uses a SmartTV to view the page, and it stopped working.

> Fun fact: many SmartTVs are built on old versions of Chromium and are never updated. Our users TV is on Chrome 56.

The particular error we were seeings was `AbortController is undefined`, and tracing it backwards to the `FetchHttpClient` class of SignalR shows a small issue:

[https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/FetchHttpClient.ts](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/FetchHttpClient.ts)

```typescript
if (typeof fetch === 'undefined') {
  // In order to ignore the dynamic require in webpack builds we need to do this magic
  // @ts-ignore: TS doesn't know about these names
  const requireFunc = typeof __webpack_require__ === 'function' ? __non_webpack_require__ : require;

  // Cookies aren't automatically handled in Node so we need to add a CookieJar to preserve cookies across requests
  this.jar = new (requireFunc('tough-cookie').CookieJar)();
  this.fetchType = requireFunc('node-fetch');

  // node-fetch doesn't have a nice API for getting and setting cookies
  // fetch-cookie will wrap a fetch implementation with a default CookieJar or a provided one
  this.fetchType = requireFunc('fetch-cookie')(this.fetchType, this.jar);

  // Node needs EventListener methods on AbortController which our custom polyfill doesn't provide
  this.abortControllerType = requireFunc('abort-controller');
} else {
  this.fetchType = fetch.bind(self);
  this.abortControllerType = AbortController;
}
```

The error occurs on the line `this.abortControllerType = AbortController;`. But why do we get here? Well it's because some older browsers, like Chrome 56, don't support `AbortController` but do support `fetch`. That's how this issue occurs.

I filed an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30458) about this, and I got the response I was expecting. `Wontfix` because why would you support Chrome 56ish? I honestly don't blame the team here.

So how can you work around it? My theory was to check if `fetch` and `AbortController` existed BEFORE loading SignalR. This is done early in my application:

```typescript
if (typeof fetch !== 'undefined' && typeof AbortController === 'undefined') {
  console.warn(
    'Fetch is supported, but not AbortController.  Dropping default fetch so SignalR can override.'
  );
  window.fetch = undefined;
}
```

Why does this work? Well, if `fetch` is defined but `AbortController` is not, we know we're going to have issues. SignalR has its own polyfill for `fetch` if `fetch` doesn't exist. So we simply make fetch undefined globally and let SignalR do it's work for us!

> NOTE: no warranty how this affects other libraries that use `fetch`. I'm using Axios in addition to our SignalR stuff, and had zero problems.

I hope this helps you in the future! If it did, hit me up and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1kevgriff) and let me know!
