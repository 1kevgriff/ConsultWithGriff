Don't you just hate errors that will tell you something is wrong, but not tell you what? I've been a fan of [Azure Functions for years](/i-love-azure-static-web-apps), but I ran into this frustrating case recently while refactoring an Azure Functions project.

![No bindings found in function](./images/20241031-azure-functions-host-error.jpg)

```cli
Worker failed to index functions
Result: Failure
Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Functions must declare at least one binding. No bindings were found in the function $func.
at Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.GrpcWorker.GetFunctionMetadataAsync(String functionAppDirectory)
```

Notice how this error message doesn't tell you which function is missing bindings? I mean, it really wants too. See that **$func**? It's trying to tell you which function is missing bindings, but it's not going to just come out and say it.

What's causing the error? It's because I have a **[Function()]** but no triggers.

So how do you figure out which function is messed up or missing the bindings? The trick I used was to search GitHub for the error message I was getting. That led me to [this line of code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/sdk/FunctionMetadataLoaderExtension/FunctionMetadataJsonReader.cs#L29). Generally speaking, the Azure Function host is looking for the **bindings** sections in the function metadata.

The function metadata is generated at compile time, and it's stored in a file named **functions.metadata**. I found the file in my **bin** folder for the project. Within moments, I saw the problem.

First, here is an example of a well-defined function:

```json
{
  "name": "AliveCheck",
  "scriptFile": "{... removed for brevity ...}",
  "entryPoint": "{... removed for brevity ...}",
  "language": "dotnet-isolated",
  "properties": {
    "IsCodeless": false
  },
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "In",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "Function",
      "methods": ["GET"],
      "properties": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "Out"
    }
  ]
}
```

You'll notice that the **bindings** section is present, and multiple entries.

My function was missing a **bindings** section.

```json
{
  "name": "GetWorkItems",
  "scriptFile": "{... removed for brevity ...}",
  "entryPoint": "{... removed for brevity ...}",
  "language": "dotnet-isolated",
  "properties": {
    "IsCodeless": false
  },
  "bindings": []
}
```

Why was this happening? It's because I forgot to add a Trigger to my function. Here's what I had:

```csharp
[Function(nameof(GetWorkItems))]
public async Task<List<WorkItem>> GetWorkItems(string workItemType)
{
    // ...
}
```

Notice there is no Trigger! That's why the function was missing the **bindings** section in the metadata.

This problem was quickly resolved by adding a trigger to the function.

```csharp
[Function(nameof(GetWorkItems))]
public async Task<List<WorkItem>> GetWorkItems([QueueTrigger("work-items")] string workItemType)
{
    // ...
}
```

I hope this helps you resolve the same or similar problem.
